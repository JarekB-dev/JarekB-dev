  About Me
</h2>

<p align='left'>I am a security professional, for which I was awarded the Security of the Year 2020 award. My career goal is to move into the world of software development. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Software Development course at Code Institute. I am also developing my skills by participating in Hackatons and webinars, as well as creating projects from scratch. My goal is to gain the experience necessary to become a successful software developer. I am confident that I have the skills that will allow me to make the transition and become an asset to any software development team.
